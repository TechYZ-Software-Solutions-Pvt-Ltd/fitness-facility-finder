- âœ… Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
- âœ… Runs your app
- âœ… Provides HTTPS URL
- âœ… Auto-deploys on code changes

## ðŸ”§ Custom Configuration (Optional)

If you need custom settings, create a `railway.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "streamlit run src/app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0"
healthcheckPath = "/_stcore/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
```
