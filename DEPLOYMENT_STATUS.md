# 🚀 JustList - Deployment Status

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - PRODUCTION READY**

### 🎉 **Critical Bug Fixed!**

**Issue:** Search was failing with "No facilities found" for all queries

**Root Cause:** Missing trailing slash in Google Places API base URL
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
GOOGLE_PLACES_BASE_URL = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place"

# After (FIXED):
GOOGLE_PLACES_BASE_URL = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/"
```

**Impact:** This caused 404 errors on ALL Google API requests

**Resolution:** Fixed in commit `d80d97b` - Search now works perfectly! ✅
