# üîç Debug Search History - Step by Step

## Let's Find Out Why It's Not Working

Please follow these steps **exactly** and tell me what you see:

---

## **Step 1: Check Browser Console**

1. Open your app: https://techyz-software-solutions-pvt-ltd.github.io/justlist/
2. Press **F12** (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
5. Login to your account
6. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
7. Click **Search History** tab

### **What do you see in the console?**

Look for lines starting with `[Search History]`

**Expected:**
```
[Search History] Loading page 0 for user: your-username
[Search History] API URL: https://justlist.onrender.com
[Search History] API Response: [...]
```

**Tell me:**
- What does `[Search History] API URL:` show?
- Is it `https://justlist.onrender.com` or `http://localhost:8000`?
- Are there any red error messages?

---

## **Step 2: Check Network Tab**

1. Still in Developer Tools
2. Click the **Network** tab
3. Click **Search History** tab in the app
4. Look for a request to `/facilities/history`

**Tell me:**
- Do you see the request?
- What URL is it calling?
- What is the status code? (200, 404, 401, 500?)
- Click on the request ‚Üí **Response** tab ‚Üí What does it say?

---

## **Step 3: Test Backend Directly**

Open these URLs in a new tab:

### **3a. Health Check:**
```
https://justlist.onrender.com/health
```
**Expected:** `{"status":"healthy"}`

**What do you see?**

### **3b. Check if you're logged in:**
After logging in to the app, open:
```
https://justlist.onrender.com/facilities/history?skip=0&limit=5
```

**Tell me:**
- What does it show?
- Does it ask for login?
- Does it show an error?
- Does it show `[]` (empty array)?

---

## **Step 4: Verify Search Actually Saves**

1. Do a **NEW search** right now:
   - Country: India
   - State: Kerala
   - Facility: Gym
2. Wait for results to appear
3. Open Settings ‚Üí Search History

**Tell me:**
- Did the search complete successfully?
- Did you see results?
- Does history still say "No search history yet"?

---

## **Step 5: Check Local Storage**

In the Console tab, type:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('access_token')
```

**Tell me:**
- Do you see a long token string?
- Or do you see `null`?

---

## **Common Issues:**

### **Issue A: Token Not Saved**
If `access_token` is `null`, you're not actually logged in.
**Solution:** Logout and login again.

### **Issue B: Wrong API URL**
If console shows `localhost:8000`, the build didn't work.
**Solution:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete), hard refresh (Ctrl+F5).

### **Issue C: CORS Error**
If you see red CORS errors in console.
**Solution:** Backend needs to allow your domain.

### **Issue D: 401 Unauthorized**
If `/facilities/history` returns 401.
**Solution:** Token expired or invalid. Logout and login again.

### **Issue E: Empty Array `[]`**
If API returns empty array, searches aren't being saved.
**Solution:** Check if search is calling the correct endpoint.

---

## **Please Provide:**

Copy and paste the following information:

1. **Console logs** (especially `[Search History]` lines)
2. **Network request URL** for `/facilities/history`
3. **Response** from `/facilities/history` request
4. **Result** from `https://justlist.onrender.com/health`
5. **Any error messages** (red text in console)

With this information, I can pinpoint the exact issue! üîç
